  <h3>Our Values</h3>
  <p>We are committed to championing and promoting equal opportunity.
    Everyone has a right to be treated with dignity and respect, with equal opportunities and without discrimination, irrespective of their background. We are working hard to ensure that we better reflect the communities we serve.<br>The Lifeline Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES) is a set of 10 specific measures (metrics) which enables Lifeline organisations to compare the workplace and career experiences of disabled and non-disabled staff. The aim is to use the metrics data to develop and publish an action plan and together with a year-on-year comparison. This will enable us to demonstrate progress against the indicators of disability equality.<br>
     Three core principles are critical to our service, guiding everything we do and inspiring us to be the best.<ul>

  <li>We care about our donors, their families, the patients we serve, and our people.</li>
<li>We are expert at meeting the needs of those who use our service and those who operate it.</li>
<li>We provide quality products, services and experiences for donors, patients and colleagues	</li></ul><</p>
